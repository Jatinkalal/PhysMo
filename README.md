# Physics-Aware Refinement of 3D Human Motion

## Introduction
This project focuses on physics-aware refinement of text-generated human motion, aiming to ensure that the resulting animations are physically realistic and free from common artifacts such as foot-skating, floating, and ground penetration. The motion data is represented as 3D joint positions across frames, while the human body is modeled using the SMPL representation with 21 joints with downstream applications in animation & gaming industries.

## Qualitative Results 
![All](https://github.com/Jatinkalal/PhysMo/blob/main/images/Rep_image.jpg)
In this figure we conclude that our results show minimal physics artifacts such as floating, penetration & foot-skating in-comparison to SOTA method.

## Qualitative Results (video)

From the above video, we can see that we possess minimal artifacts in-comparison to SOTA method.


### More details to be updated soon.
